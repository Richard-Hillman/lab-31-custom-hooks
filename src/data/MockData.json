    "description": "Absalom was the leader of a cult in Montana that believed in a coming apocalypse. \"Absalom\", in fact, was an alias for Travis Clayton Moberly, who was a fugitive wanted for credit card theft, grand larceny, mail fraud, and receiving stolen property. This occurred after he led a cult predicting the end of the world in 2000. However, as it failed to happen, the cult dissolved and Absalom went underground – with the members' money. He resurfaced in 2001, around the time when Theresa Hoese was returned after her abduction. Agents Scully and Doggett sought out Absalom, hoping for clues to the whereabouts of Fox Mulder. It turned out that Absalom was rescuing returned abductees and healing them with the aid of Jeremiah Smith. Absalom was not forthcoming with any assistance. He was arrested by Scully and sent to prison. (TXF: \"This is Not Happening\", \"DeadAlive\")",

Billy snagged the ticket and ran outside, despite protests from Weems that something bad would inevitably happen if he did. Sure enough, as soon as he ran outside, Billy was hit by a truck but survived. (TXF: \"The Goldberg Variation\")",

    "description": "Billy Underwood was the son of Doug and Lisa Underwood. He was abducted in 1990. He disappeared in broad daylight and no progress was ever made in the search for him or his body. In 2000, he miraculously reappeared, albeit without having aged a single day. The bizarre nature of his reappearance brought in FBI Special Agents Dana Scully and John Doggett to investigate. While Lisa Underwood was thrilled at Billy's return, her husband and second son, Josh, were frightened – particularly when Billy appeared to attack Josh with a bloody hunting knife. As the agents continued their investigation, they learned of the involvement of Ronald Purnell in Billy's disappearance. Purnell had been forced into drugging Billy for abduction by Cal Jeppy. Doggett got Purnell to help and ultimately arrested Jeppy, who had also kidnapped Josh Underwood. On Jeppy's property, the agents discovered Billy's corpse and the boy – which they now understood to be a strikingly realistic apparition, of sorts – disappeared again. (TXF: \"Invocation\")",

During a key experiment, he entered a chamber and was exposed to intense dark matter radiation that turned his shadow into a killer void that disintegrated any living matter it crossed. Banton went on the run for fear that the government would use his experiments for sinister purposes or imprison him for study and experimentation. Following the disintegration deaths of several people and two police officers, he met Mulder and Scully, in whom he saw safety. Mulder sought assistance from X in dealing with Banton, but X betrayed Mulder's confidence and used knowledge of Banton's whereabouts to find him. Banton attempted to reverse the dark matter exposure by entering the experiment chamber again, but was thwarted and subsequently apprehended by X. Banton's worst fears thus came true, as he was immediately locked in a cell for scientific observation by the government. (TXF: \"Soft Light\")",

Scully traveled with the Smoking Man after the supposedly miraculous cure of Jason McPeck to retrieve a data disc containing the genetic research into the alien technology. The Smoking Man claimed that he wished Scully to use the cure wisely and prove that he was capable of more than just destruction. After dinner with the Smoking Man, Scully was given instructions to meet with Cobra the following morning. The two of them rendezvoused in boats where she was given the disc. Cobra was familiar with Scully, but she insisted they had never spoken. Instantly, it became clear that Cobra had been manipulated into believing that he had actually been communicating with Scully when he had, in fact, not. Before he could explain, Cobra was shot dead by the Black-Haired Man. (TXF: \"En Ami\")",

While Mulder traveled to England to look into crop circle phenomena, he had Scully visit Colleen to pick up her research for Mulder to read upon his return. When Scully met Colleen, she was uncharacteristically rude and trite, due to her uncomfortable reunion with Daniel Waterston. Scully returned to apologize and spoke with Colleen at great length concerning spiritual matters. Scully learned that Colleen used to be a physicist but was never truly happy until she allowed herself to be herself after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Colleen believed that holding inside stress and anything that wasn't natural led to medical issues. In her case, it was a loving relationship with another woman named Carol. Scully had Colleen assist with alternative medicine with Waterston, who gave it no credence. Nevertheless, Colleen's discussion with Scully helped her to make amends with Margaret Waterston and ultimately learn to believe in the same things as Mulder. (TXF: \"all things\")",

During the course of the investigation, during which Mulder stayed in the Adderly home, Mulder discovered that Ellen's husband had been having two affairs - one with Crittendon and one with Jenny Uphouse. Ellen was aware of her husband's infidelity, but denied herself any reaction to it to maintain the image of a perfect life. However, when Crittendon became pregnant, Ellen's other self killed her. Ellen first became aware that something about her was amiss when she discovered a stab wound in her shoulder that Jenny Uphouse inflicted while defending herself - futilely - against Adderly's other self. Mulder approached Adderly about this, but she promptly transformed again and tried to drown Mulder in a bathtub. However, Adderly was unable to comprehend seeing herself - there was a trail of broken mirrors and other reflective surfaces wherever she went - and saw her own reflection in the water while trying to drown Mulder. Shocked at seeing herself, she transformed back and cowered in a corner while Mulder recovered himself. Adderly was then committed in a mental hospital. (TXF: \"Chimera\")",

Gogolak was a businessman who worked for Pier 9 Imports and often traveled to the Far East to countries such as Tibet and Taiwan. While there, he apparently obtained the ability to summon a tulpa, which took the form as the Ubermenscher. Gogolak used the Ubermenscher to enforce his will upon the community, occasionally using it to kill resident who failed to conform, including Dave and Nancy Kline. When Rob and Laura Petrie moved in, Gogolak had Win Shroeder discern whatever he could about them. Ultimately, Gogolak had the Ubermenchser attack Mike Raskub for expressing concern over the Petries' safety. Mulder eventually figured out that Gogolak was behind the mysterious disappearances that occurred in the neighborhood, which prompted Gogolak to sic the Ubermenscher on him. However, Mulder handcuffed Gogolak to a mailbox while the Ubermenscher was on the prowl. Unable to control the being, Gogolak was attacked and killed by his own monster, which then caused the monster to cease existing. (TXF: \"Arcadia\")",

Mulder gave Piller more credence than Scully and allowed him to participate in the investigation, during which Piller discovered a connection between the LaPierre case and Samantha Mulder. One night, Piller demanded Mulder's attention and claimed that his mother was present and needed to convey something to Mulder. Mulder began to lose faith in Piller, but discovered that he had somehow written down \"April Base\" without even knowing it. Mulder and Piller went to the Air Force base and were led to the house where Samantha lived while a subject of the Project with Jeffrey Spender. Ultimately, Mulder was able to contact Samantha in a strange, mystical manner and give him closure over her disappearance and death. Mulder also encountered Piller's son, whom Piller had been searching for and was still a suspect in his disappearance.

    "description": "Jackson Van De Kamp, was born William Scully [1] the son of Dana Scully. He was long thought, for 17 years, to be the biological child of Fox Mulder. However, in the series finale the Cigarette Smoking Man claimed to be his biological father and \"creator\" (TXF: “My Struggle III”). While this seems definitive, all the characters are given is the Cigarette Smoking Man's word, and due to the convoluted nature of the mythology arc there is as much evidence that negates this supposed truth as supports it. In the context of the whole series it seems more realistic, that the Cigarette Smoking Man's experiments on William before his birth might have been derived from whatever he did with Jeffrey Spender and maybe what he learnt when he tried to transfer Mulder's immunity on himself. (TXF: \"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati”). The experiments with William were more related to super-soldiers (USS Valor Victory), an attempt for the aliens to turn William into one of their own. (TXF: \"Nothing Important Happened Today II\", \"Trust No 1\", \"William\", \"The Truth\").",

This Smith, who worked in Washington, D.C., was captured by the Syndicate and held for execution by the Alien Bounty Hunter, but was able to escape by dealing with the Cigarette-Smoking Man, offering to heal his lung cancer and be set free. He was then contacted by Mulder and Scully brought Smith to him, in a secluded area, in hope that he would save the life of Mulder's mother, who had just suffered a stroke. The bounty hunter soon arrived. (TXF: \"Talitha Cumi\") Smith ran from the bounty hunter through an abandoned warehouse and escaped with Mulder's and Scully's help. While Mulder tried to kill the bounty hunter, Smith tried to escape, but Mulder pleaded with him to help his mother. Leaving Scully behind, Smith convinced Mulder that his mother was watched by the Syndicate and instead brought Mulder to Alberta, Canada and revealed a Syndicate-run plantation involving bees, child labour, and young clones of his sister Samantha. Confronted with the bounty hunter yet again, they fled into a bunker filled with beehives. They set a trap for the bounty hunter and were able to escape, but the bounty hunter caught up to them while Mulder called Scully. Smith fled during the fight, leaving Mulder on his own.

He had disguised himself as a man because he fell in love with baseball and wished to escape the other aliens.

When Dales found him dying and held him in his arms, Exley became hysterical and warned him not to touch him as alien blood was toxic to humans. But when Arthur showed Exley the blood on his hands, it was red. Exley had become a man through his love of baseball and because he embodied the essential qualities that make men, men.

In exchange for a commuted sentence, he promised assistance to FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, with a murder investigation they were carrying out. The agents' discussion with Boggs was especially troubling for Scully because Boggs claimed to be able to speak to Scully's recently deceased father and provided strong evidence that he could. Mulder was not convinced and did not believe Boggs to be a psychic. Although Boggs actually somehow solved the murder through his psychic abilities, his assistance was insufficient to commute his sentence and he was executed. (TXF: \"Beyond the Sea\")",

Maitreya was based on a digital scan of Jade Blue Afterglow. In the game, Maitreya took on a life of her own and killed an actual player, Retro, with a flintlock pistol. Mulder and Scully were called in to investigate the bizarre murder. Scully dismissed Maitreya as an \"immature, hormonal fantasy.\" The situation worsened when Maitreya faced Darryl Musashi, whose hands she cut off before decapitating him. When The Lone Gunmen entered the game and were unable to escape, Mulder went to help them. Instead of leaving the game space with them, he pursued Maitreya, who nearly killed him with a 14th-century broadsword. Eventually, the agents were able to destroy the program with Phoebe's help. With FPS in ruins, its creator, Ivan Martinez, was very despondent until the image of Maitreya seemed to reappear on his workstation - but with Scully's face. (TXF: \"First Person Shooter\")",

Black's insight led the agents directly to Johnson's rural Maryland home, where he had a hobby of taxidermy and where the four summoned beings were kept in his basement. While investigating the house, Mulder was locked in the basement with the zombie-like creatures, but he protected himself within a circle of salt on the ground. Black realized that Mulder would not be able to handle Johnson himself, so he went to help. Johnson believed that Black was availing himself to be a fourth such being after Mulder shot one in the head, effectively re-killing it. Black had no such intention and tied up Johnson. Along with Scully, he was able to save Mulder and destroy the remaining zombies. Johnson was then taken into custody. (TXF: \"Millennium\")",

He awoke one morning to discover himself in jail and being transferred to another facility when he was suddenly shot dead by Al Cawdry. However, he woke up the next day, which was actually the previous day. As time progressed forward for him, it progressed backward for everyone else - even though everyone else was experiencing time normally. This made it very difficult for him to speak with Agents Doggett and Scully and his attorney, Janet Wilson, about his case. The reason he was in jail was for the murder of his wife, Vicky Wells. As Wells continued to progress backward through time, he learned that the murderer was actually Cesar Ocampo, who slashed Wells' face while also in the lockup. Wells eventually awoke the day before he went to jail and was able to apprehend Ocumpo with Doggett's assistance. Ocumpo explained that he was seeking revenge for Wells' incarceration of his brother, Hector Ocampo, who had recently committed suicide in prison. Wells was guilty of suppression of evidence that led to Ocumpo's imprisonment. The next day, Wells awoke again and was able to save his wife's life but was nearly killed by Ocumpo - who had come to his apartment to kill Vicky. As Ocumpo was about to kill Wells instead of his wife, Scully and Doggett arrived, who shot Ocumpo dead. Wells recognized that he had been given a bizarre second chance to change events and save his wife, but it was his own actions that endangered her in the first place. Having confessed to Doggett in order to secure his help, Wells was sent to prison for suppressing evidence, a result he fully accepted. (TXF: \"Redrum\")",

He quickly warmed up to Rob and Laura Petrie after dropping a box labeled \"china\" that was actually full of FBI surveillance equipment. He quickly brought over some of his own dishes to make up for his accident. Raskub had dinner with Gene Gogolak and Win Shroeder that evening and expressed hope that they would warn the Petries of the consequences of not following the rules. Raskub was clearly terrified of voicing his opinion, and was gently dismissed by Gogolak. Later that night, Raskub was attacked by the Ubermenscher on the command of Gogolak.",

In 2000, Dana Scully investigated a murder that took place near their township and found her way into town. However, she was given water in her gas tank and there was no telephone service so she was forced to spend the night in Milsap's home. She tried to treat Hank Gulatarski, who was being used as a host for the parasite. However, Scully realized that she was dealing with a cult and tried to find a way for her and Gulatarski to escape. Gulatarski eventually gave in to the cultists and was stoned to death so that Scully could be given the parasite. If not for the timely appearance of John Doggett, Scully likely would have suffered the same fate. After removing the parasite from Scully's back, Doggett shot it dead, much to the horror of the worshipers. (TXF: \"Roadrunners\")",

This doctor was believed to have died in 1965, but had actually come to the United States and continued his work under the name Shiro Zama. The Syndicate employed him and his colleagues in their hybridization experiments as part of the colonization project. These experiments involved gene therapy hybridization performed on the homeless and insane who were later taken by Doctor Zama to the Hansen's Disease Research Facility, where the gene therapy effects (burns and a half-human, half-alien physiognomy) was believed to be leprosy deformity, although the colony's original patients were aware of the difference.",
