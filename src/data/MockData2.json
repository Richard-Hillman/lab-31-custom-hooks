    "description": "Absalom was the leader of a cult in Montana that believed in a coming apocalypse. \"Absalom\", in fact, was an alias for Travis Clayton Moberly, who was a fugitive wanted for credit card theft, grand larceny, mail fraud, and receiving stolen property. This occurred after he led a cult predicting the end of the world in 2000. However, as it failed to happen, the cult dissolved and Absalom went underground â€“ with the members' money. He resurfaced in 2001, around the time when Theresa Hoese was returned after her abduction. Agents Scully and Doggett sought out Absalom, hoping for clues to the whereabouts of Fox Mulder. It turned out that Absalom was rescuing returned abductees and healing them with the aid of Jeremiah Smith. Absalom was not forthcoming with any assistance. He was arrested by Scully and sent to prison. (TXF: \"This is Not Happening\", \"DeadAlive\")",
